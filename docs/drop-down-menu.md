I love working with markdown because i don't have to learn a bunch of syntax to use markdown. In fact, applications like Obsidian and Typora make it even esier to write your thoughts down.



Where the two app differce bwtween the two apps is the Obsidian is great for personal knoledge management but it is worthless wieh you have to write documentation for `Github`.



## Typora VS Obsidian

But when you have documents that are 2000 word or more Typora lack the styling that i need when Im writing out my thoughts. and besides there is a lot of plugins to choose from. and there is nothing that you can get for Typora in terms of plugins. 



I will say the absolute best thing about Obsidian that I can't say about Typora is the Obsidian is free. once I can find the right theme for Typora I'm gong to use obsidian for my research, and leaning.
