I love working with markdown because i don't have to learn a bunch of syntax to use markdown. In fact, applications like Obsidian and Typora make it even esier to write your thoughts down.



Where the two app differce bwtween the two apps is the Obsidian is great for personal knoledge management but it is worthless wieh you have to write documentation for `Github`.
